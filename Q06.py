# Q06. Factorial (for loop)
#
# Ask the user for a non-negative integer n.
# Compute and print its factorial (n!) using a for loop.
#
# Recall: 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120, and 0! = 1.
#
# Sample Input 1:   Enter a number: 5
# Sample Output 1:  5! = 120
#
# Sample Input 2:   Enter a number: 0
# Sample Output 2:  0! = 1

# --- YOUR CODE HERE ---
n=int(input("Enter a number: "))

fact=1
for i in range(1,n+1):
    fact*=i
print(fact)
